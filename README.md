# Tooling alcoholic
Project that should answers questions like "What editor do you use?"

#### What is it?
This is an application where you would be able to find a specific person's tools, look for tools by company/country/age/etc. 
After googling I wasn't able to find similar already existing tool that will coverage such needs. So there is only one way - create one :)

#### Why humanity need this tool?
More often I see questions about tools on twitter or youtube comments. 
On one hand this is normally, cause can like some color theme of other person. 
It means there will be a question about it. But what if there would be one hundred such persons. 
It will ennoy person that have that color theme. To avoid such situations you would be able just google
our tool and type persons name/twitter nickname or else. 
Moreover you would be able to create your own setup and share it to the world!

#### Why such name?
Thanks to Mattias Petter Johansson (https://twitter.com/mpjme). Please watch the video, where he explained this phrase (01:22 minute)

But if short, I am also tooling alcoholic. 
So often I appear in situation where for one hour I am trying to find new color schemes instead of coding :)

#### Technologies

#### When it will be ready?
Honestly, I have no idea. I will try to make commits each day.
