Roadmap to remember each time opening code editor:
 ✔ Implement type deletion. Simple version without any relations. @done (18-12-18 23:51)
 ✔ Re-think component model. Component should contains styles inside? Or be in the same folder? @done (18-12-19 12:43)
 ✔ Remove css-modules looader from webpack config. @done (18-12-19 12:43)
 ✔ Implement type edit. Think about making shared component for add/edit. @done(18-12-20 18:04)
 ☐ Start making tools page (backend CRUD). Think about relations with users as owner and tool types. Think about fields that should be there.
 ☐ Make interface component for tools.
 ☐ Implement deep type tool deletion.
 ☐ Move adding section to separate component.
 ☐ Think on loading for each button clicks (till server response).
