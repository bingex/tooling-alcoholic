Roadmap to remember each time opening code editor:
 ✔ Implement type deletion. Simple version without any relations. @done (18-12-18 23:51)
 ☐ Re-think component model. Component should contains styles inside? Or be in the same folder?
 ☐ Implement type edit. Think about making shared component for add/edit.
 ☐ Start making tools page (backend CRUD). Think about relations with users as owner and tool types. Think about fields that should be there.
 ☐ Make interface component for tools.
 ☐ Implement deep type tool deletion.
 ☐ Move adding section to separate component.
 ☐ Think on loading for each button clicks (till server response).
